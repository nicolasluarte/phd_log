  + PCR reaction generates copies of a DNA template exponentially
  + Due to inhibitors of PCR found within the template, the PCR reaction eventually ceases to generate template at an exponential rate
  + rt PCR is the reliable detection and measurement of products generated during each cycle of the PCR process
  + phosphoryl 5' hydroxyl 3'
  + polymerase (Taq) catalyzes DNA synthesis

  + The probe has a flourescent reporter dye attached to its 5' end and quencher dye at it 3' terminus
  + Additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes with each cycle, leading to an increase in fluorescence intensity proportional to the amount of amplicon produced

  #+CAPTION: PCR cycles

  + baseline: reporter fluorescent signal is accumulating but is beneath the limits of detection of the instrument
  + delta Rn: fluorescence emission at each time point minus fluorescence emission of the baseline
  + threshold: ten-times the standard deviation of the average signal of the baseline fluorescent signal between cycles 3 to 15
  + Ct: fraction PCR cycle number at which the reporter fluorescent is greater that the minimal detection level
