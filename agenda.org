+ PCR reaction generates copies of a DNA template exponentially
+ Due to inhibitors of PCR found within the template, the PCR reaction eventually ceases to generate template at an exponential rate
+ rt PCR is the reliable detection and measurement of products generated during each cycle of the PCR process
+ phosphoryl 5' hydroxyl 3'
+ polymerase (Taq) catalyzes DNA synthesis
